##what am i trying to accomplish today

- lay out reasons why its okay to refactor

- lay out some ways to mimimize the need to refactor

- connect the dots between an etch a sketch and development

# stetch goal

---
##what am i not trying to say

- all code should be rewritten

- you should look to refactor at any given time

- any minor change in an application should require refactoring

#caveats

- this is what works for our team (most of the time)

#this is not for the perfect world

at the end of the day my team has to build products.
we write good code
we write code knowing that it will not be used very long
deadlines and client expectations factor into how we build applications

#one last caveat

- a team needs to have:

  - trust

  - respect

  - open communication

  - a voice

???
this is really for any team to succeeed
but this is very important if you are talking about this subject
---
layout: false
class: middle
# why am i talking about this?
- i write bad code

- i'm a bad developer

- wanting to refactor code admits the above

???

expectations of perfection in writing code is not reasonable. sometimes it brings on the feelings of imposter syndrome
heaven forbid you do something wrong

#why does my code suck?

.left-column[
 ### perfect world
]
.right-column[

- requirements are set well before development starts

- third party libraries are static (or at least interfaces never change)

- technologies are never modified

- one code project (constantly tweaking and improving)

- code complexity analysis

# stetch goal
![](img/etch-a-sketch.jpg)
---
.left-column[
 ### perfect world
 ### real world
]
.right-column[

- requirements change

- scopes change

- use cases change

- third party libraries are updated rapidly

- third party libraries are deprecated or abandoned

- new workflows are introduced

- dozens of projects (some haven't been touched in years)

- something new comes out that is just plain better for your use-case

]
???
does it really make sense to keep on building on top of a framework or module when you know that something else out there is better?

##last year i created a [demo](https://github.com/jvrousseau/thunderplains-prototype-demo) with hapijs.

##using version 6.9.0
##~~today's version 10.4.1~~
##~~today's version 10.5.0~~
##~~today's version 11.0.0~~
##~~today's version 11.0.1~~
##today's version [11.0.3](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/package.json#L5)

not saying version history means things change so much you have to refactor...
you need to keep up with your dependencies so you don't have a problem on your hands months later

##2013 - workflow control library used [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async)
<br/>
##today - we use [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird)

---

#question?

##does using async.js in 2013 mean we were bad developers?
<br/>
##does a team that started using async.js this year mean they are bad developers?

#migrating to bluebird (get it??)

- we had to change a lot of code

- some projects still uses asnyc.js

- when we add functionality to old code we will refactor to use bluebird

it should be a team-wide decision a singular person should make a decision that will impact the entire team

you're code should be something you are proud of.
it should be beautiful

#keep refactoring in your back pocket

work to make your code re-usable and maintainable so you don't have to refactor
if you're refactoring all the time, there's no room to improve the application
---

#when ~~refactoring~~ developing keep in mind:

- re-usability

- mantainability

- dry

- separation of concerns

- it will never be perfect

just like an end-user product, code quality osciallates to something you are happy with

#you will eventually ask yourself, "what was i thinking?"

you will want to completely re-write a codebase you have already refactored!

---
.left-column[
 ### documentation
]
.right-column[

- helpful for maintainablity

- you will be less likely to curse your past self

- you will find the inconsistancies and innefficiencies in your code

- rubber duck debugging

]

documentation forces you to expalin the code to yourself

.left-column[
 ### documentation
 ### mini code reviews
]
.right-column[

- create feature branches for any changes

- before push to staging have a small code review

- you will miss bugs if you have too many changes in a PR

bugs you will have to eventually fix

.left-column[

 ### mini code reviews
 ### microservices
]
.right-column[

- small applications that do one thing well

- pinpoint failures much easier

- much less time investment on building each microservice

- refactoring is much less daunting on microservice rather than a monolithic application
